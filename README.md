# Skyscanner Data Analytics Migration Tableau

**Tools:** Python, PostgreSQL, Tableau

Assuming the role of a Data Analyst at Skyscanner, I worked on this project to migrate existing data analytics tasks from an Excel-based manual system into interactive Tableau reports. 

In brief, I extract data from a 10 different excel workbooks, contain flights data of 10 different years. I cleaned this combined 7.9+ GB of data, trnasformed them into one single pandas dataframe, and created a unified clean workable dataset. Then I loaded this dataset into a PostgreSQL server. Finally using Tableau, I connected to the database and created informative reports.
